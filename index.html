            <section>
                <p>I am a U.S. Air Force veteran, an electronics enthusiast, an aspiring Maker/woodworker and I volunteer with youth (though that is on hiatus while I am in school). I am very customer-centric, taking ownership of issues that seem to take longer than they should to resolve, serving as their advocate in rallying the correct personnel in resolving the issue when appropriate. I am also very quality-minded and can be meticulous and highly focused at times.</p>
                <p>I was introduced to electronics early on and interested in computers long before I could afford one. I was talked into joining Marine Corps Junior ROTC in High School and combined the two when I joined the Air Force in Active Duty, with a Computer Repair specialty.</p>
                <p>As with many veterans, transitioning back to civilian life was a process, but I eventually re-entered the electronics field doing hardware repair and testing, continuing that type of work to the present day. After re-joining civilian life, I finished out my military schooling with an Associate in Technology from Pierce College, and continued to take additional coursework there. In my current job I have added Field Installation and Service Work to the mix.  This gets me out among my customers, which I very much enjoy.  After seven years of that, I have very good relationships with many of them.</p>
                <p>I have over 25 years experience with, and currently work again on Point of Sale computer hardware and peripherals, with some configuration programming work and software support of the POS applications my employer supports. This has resulted in a diverse scope of training attendent with supporting a wide range of hardware from several manufacturers.</p>
                <p>In both professional and personal pursuits, I have acquired some understanding of Assembly Language, used the DOS Editor, and written Batch files and BASIC in the MS-DOS environment, used to 'hand code' my ebay pages in HTML4, and have begun to explore Debian Linux and Python with a Raspberry Pi as a hobby.</p>
                <p>Changes in the industry, my employment environment, and interest levels have directed me toward my current pursuit of studying software development at Code Fellows.  I am currently studying HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript there with a goal of becoming "professional-grade."</p>
                <p>On a personal note, I enjoy clever wordplay, ancient history, science fiction, a wide range of music (ranging from Classical through EDM), machining and manual craft in wood, metal, and other materials, and of course, tinkering with computers.</p>
                <p>As part of the assignment from which this page has arisen, I have a quiz for you below.</p>
